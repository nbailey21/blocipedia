Nichipedia is a collaborative wiki application created using Ruby on Rails application. Users can create and collaborate on wikis. Users can pay to upgrade their membership, allowing them to view and create private wikis.

Users can create a standard account or a premium account. With a standard account, users can create, edit, and collaborate on public wikis using Markdown syntax. Anyone can view public wikis.

Users can pay to upgrade their account to premium which allows them to view and create private wikis. Private wikis allow the premium user to give viewing and collaborating permissions to other users.

Premium users can downgrade their account back to standard. When a user downgrades his or her account, his or her private wikis will automatically become public.

This project was created to further my knowledge of Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap.


Development Tools and Gems include:

Devise for user authentication
SendGrid for email confirmation
Redcarpet for Markdown formatting
Pundit for authorization
Stripe for payments
